# MFEK GPT-3 Policy

**Parts of this project were written by a type of artificial intelligence, a language model called GPT-3, as that model existed in the month of February 2023.**

[GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) is a project of [OpenAI LP](https://openai.com/).

GitHub Copilot was not used. The MFEK Foundation Inc. funded API calls. **For `typoscale`, â‰ˆ$10 in compute was used.**

MFEK pledges:

* All code generated was reviewed by a human (in practice Fred Brennan).
* All comments generated were reviewed for factual accuracy and removed if inaccurate.
* All code generated was tested and linted by a real compiler.
* GPT-3 was not told to just write code. It was given human-produced code and told to _translate_ it to Rust.
* Many functions were sent back to GPT-3 more than ten times.

# `typoscale` specific GPT-3 information

* I estimate that GPT-3 saved me 80% of the time it would've taken to write **v0.1.0** from scratch. That version is very simple so this is likely to go down significantly.
